# Welcome!

This place is full of juicy docs and stuff to make an awesome integration with
Union. This documentation only covers the latest version of the API. Old APIs
will not be documented and you should not use them

## Something is missing!!1!

All of these docs are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Union-Chat/Union-Server), and
we would love your help to improve this! <3

## Applications and bots 

Currently, bots and applications are not available, but we're working on it!

## Is Union scalable?

In theory, yes. In practice, not yet
