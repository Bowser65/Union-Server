# Union
A light chat service

## Installation

To build and install everything that Union needs to work, just do `yarn run install`
and `yarn run start` to start the whole thing

`yarn run install` will create the database or migrate it if it exists, build the app,
download web interface from https://github.com/Union-Chat/union-react and generate
a default `Confuguration.json`
